Hello everyone, 

I have tried to make a simple e-commerce price scrapping. It will help you track price of a specified product and if the price is as you wish, you will recieve an e-mail as an notification for it.

I have used these library:- 

import requests [know more about the library from here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_requests.asp)
import smtplib [know more about the library from here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)
import time [know more about the library from here](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup [know about the library from here](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
